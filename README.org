* Implementation

The repository hosts a complete implementation of the SRFI, running on
[[http://call-cc.org][CHICKEN]] Scheme.

** File Description

While this repository is primarily to provide a reference
implementation of SRFI 133, it also currently serves as the base
repository to host the library as a CHICKEN extension (egg).  Thus,
there are three files that are independent of the SRFI itself, and are
as follows:


*** CHICKEN-4
=srfi-133.meta= : This file denotes metadata about the CHICKEN
extension, such as author, license, and dependencies (and dependencies
for tests).

=srfi-133.setup= : This file tells the CHICKEN package manager
(=chicken-install=) how to build the egg.

*** CHICKEN-5

=srfi-133.egg= : This file tells the CHICKEN package manager (=chicken-install=)
how to build the egg, as well as any relevant metadata about the extension.

*** All CHICKEN versions

=srfi-133.release-info= : Describes the URL / different releases of
the CHICKEN extension.

Additionally, the =tests/= directory has been added to accommodate the
CHICKEN package manager (for running tests).  Currently it provides a
default test runner which merely includes the tests found in the
=ilists/= directory.
